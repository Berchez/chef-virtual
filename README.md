## - :computer: Technologies used

In the development of Chef Virtual, several advanced technologies were used to create an exceptional user experience. Some of the main technologies employed include:

- **TypeScript:** Chef Virtual was developed using TypeScript, a programming language that adds static typing features to JavaScript, providing more robust and readable code;

- **React:** The React framework was used to build Chef Virtual's interactive and responsive user interface. React allows the creation of reusable components and facilitates efficient state management of the application;

- **Next.js:** Chef Virtual is built on Next.js, a React framework that offers advanced features such as server-side rendering, static page generation, and performance optimization. These features enable a fast and smooth user experience;

- **Tailwind CSS:** To style Chef Virtual, we used Tailwind CSS, a highly configurable utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS allows for fast and flexible development, providing a wide range of pre-defined and customizable styles;

- **GPT-4o-mini:** The heart of Chef Virtual is the use of the powerful GPT-4o-mini artificial intelligence, developed by OpenAI. GPT-4o-mini is an advanced language model that uses machine learning to generate personalized recipes based on the ingredients selected by users. It is capable of understanding natural language and producing relevant and creative results.

These technologies work together to offer an exceptional user experience on Chef Virtual, making it a modern, responsive, and intelligent website. The combination of TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and GPT-4o-mini allows us to provide an efficient, intuitive, and personalized platform for all cooking enthusiasts.
